# Contributing guide

Contributions are welcome. Please have a look at the first contributions
[help guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) if you are
new to contributing.

## <a name="branching-strategy"> Branching strategy

This project uses [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).
Features should be merged via pull requests to the `main` branch.

## <a name="commit-message-format"></a> Commit Message Format

> Inspired by the
> [AngularJS contributing guide](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

IMPORTANT: As the changelog is generated from commits, please ensure that
contributions follow these conventions, or your contribution may not be accepted
until it is corrected.

Commits are linted using
[commintlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint). Each commit
message consists of a header, a body, and a footer.

```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and must conform to the
[Commit Message Header](#commit-header) format.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits except for those of type "docs". When the
body is present it must be at least 20 characters long and must conform to the
[Commit Message Body](#commit-body) format.

The `footer` is optional. The [Commit Message Footer](#commit-footer) format
describes what the footer is used for and the structure it must have.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters.

### <a name="commit-header"></a> Commit Message Header

```
<type>: <short summary>
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: feat|fix|chore|test|docs|tooling|revert
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory.

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **feat!**: A new feature with a breaking change
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **chore**: Code maintenance changes that do not change functionality
- **wip**: Work in progress commit
- **deps**: Non-breaking dependency updates
- **test**: Add missing tests or changing existing tests
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **tooling**: Changes that affect the development tooling, build scripts or
  configuration
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

#### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no period (.) at the end

### <a name="commit-footer"></a>Commit Message Footer

The footer can contain information about breaking changes and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues, Jira tickets, and other PRs that this commit closes or is
related to.

### <a name='revert-commits'></a> Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by
the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format:
  `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit.

## <a name="typescript-style-guide"> TypeScript Style guide

All TypeScript code is linted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Most
configuration settings are set to [the recommended
defaults](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html). Please see `.prettierrc.yaml`
for any customised configuration.
